## About Snuffle Mats

Snuffle mats are interactive dog toys that stimulate a dog's sense of smell. They consist of strips of fabric tied onto a rubber mat, creating a surface that resembles grass. Small treats or kibble can be hidden among the fabric strips, encouraging dogs to use their natural foraging abilities to find food. This provides mental stimulation, slows down eating, and can help reduce anxiety in dogs.
